Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, we need to gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it; a process also called as data wrangling.

The dataset that I have wrangled (and analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though, are almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive for Udacity students exclusively to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.
